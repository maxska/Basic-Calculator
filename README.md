# Basic-Calculator
A basic calculator I created as a lab in a course I took in C#.


This project was made in the drag-and-drop GUI builder in 
Visual Studio Community 2019, in C# with Windows Forms in 
the .NET framework.

To open the project, open the file Calculator.sln.

To open the compiled file for the program, open Calculator.exe in
/Calculator/bin/Debug
