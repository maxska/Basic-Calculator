# Basic-Calculator
A basic calculator I created as a lab in a course I took in C#.

Keep in mind that I didn't really use Git at the time I made this project. 
Therefore this commit is the first available git version of the code.
However, if you'd like to see previous versions of the code, see "Form1_old..."
in the Calculator folder
